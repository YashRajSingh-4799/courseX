## Description

Welcome to the SkillLynx API Backend! This repository houses the backend server and API endpoints for the SkillLynx Course App. The backend is built using Express, a popular web framework for Node.js, and it provides the necessary functionality to handle user authentication, course management, and other data interactions for the SkillLynx Course App. This README provides essential information to set up, run, and use the SkillLynx API Backend.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
  git clone git clone https://github.com/suraj122/skillLynx-server.git

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
  cd sskillLynx-server
```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:

```
  npm install
```

### Configuration

Before running the backend server, you need to configure the environment variables for the database connection, secret keys, and other specific settings. Create a .env file at the root of the project and set your required variables like this:

```
  MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://suraj122:suraj122@cluster0.ykjpt3l.mongodb.net/"
```

### Running the Backend

To start the backend server, run the following command:

```
  npm start
```

The server will be up and running on the specified port (default is 3000).

### API Endpoints

The SkillLynx API Backend comes with pre-configured endpoints to handle user authentication, course management, and more. You can find these routes in the routes folder. Modify and add new routes to suit your application's needs.

### Authentication

After building the project, you can deploy the contents of the dist directory to your web server or hosting platform.

### Database

SkillLynx API Backend uses MongoDB as its database. You can connect to your own MongoDB instance by updating the MONGODB_URI in the .env file.
